# Year11_Transition_Work

Summer Transition Work: Create a Python-based quiz game that asks the user a series of questions, 
checks their answers, and gives them a score at the end. Use subroutines in your code.

Core Features (Required)
▪ Welcome Message
▪ Greet the user and explain the rules.
▪ Question Bank
▪ Store at least 5 questions and answers (use lists or a list of tuples).
▪ Ask Questions
▪ Loop through the questions and get user input.
▪ Check Answers
▪ Compare user input to the correct answer (case-insensitive).
▪ Score Tracking
▪ Keep track of how many answers were correct.
▪ Final Score
▪ Display the user’s score at the end with a message.

Extension tasks:
▪ Multiple Choice Format
▪ Present 3–4 options for each question.
▪ Randomized Questions but prevent same questions being asked multiple times in one 
session.
▪ Shuffle the question order each time the game runs.
▪ Timer
▪ Add a countdown timer for each question using time.sleep().
▪ Categories
▪ Let the user choose a category (e.g., Maths, Science, General Knowledge).
▪ Leader board
▪ Save high scores to a file and display them.
▪ GUI Version - Use tkinter to create a graphical version of the quiz.
▪ Sound Effects - Use the playsound module to play sounds for correct/incorrect answers.

Approximate completion time: 2 - 4 hours with most of the extension tasks
